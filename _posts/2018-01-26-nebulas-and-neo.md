Today I visited an old friend who started his own business when he was a sophomore, but failed of course. haha

Let's call him Shi for short. Shi started investing in crypto since last July. He first bought some Bytom token(BTM), which turned out to be a disaster. And then, ETH, Qtum, NEO, CZR, just all forms of ICO tokens. This has helped him to earn a looooot!

I stayed in Hangzhou for three days from Jan 25 to Jan 27. Shi kept nagging me to buy some Nebulas. What the f**k is Nebulas?! What does it do that other blockchains can't?

Shi stressed that creator of Nebulas is a really reliable BOSS.

Shi met Xu Yiji, iniator of Nebulas back in Shanghai. He told me that Xu is a capable entrepreneur, way much better than Da Hongfei, the current leader of the NEO project.

B4 Xu Yiji worked for Ant Financial. He actually initiated the NEO project with Da Hongfei, but later left the community and created Nebulas. Rumors say he had some "conflicts" with Da Hongfei.

Shi told me that he thinks Da Hongfei is kinda selfish. Sure, he is good at marketing, but doesn't know much about development. Xu Yiji, however, is proficient in technology. Shi pointed that Xu is the type pf person who is both diligent and intelligent.

Since I never met Xu and know nothing about Nebulas, I could not "judge" him. And since Shi invested a lot in Nebulas, maybe THAT'S WHY he thinks highly of it. But I must be honest that after all of Shi's shilling for Nebulas, I decided to have a view of the project's whitepaper.

**Disclaimer** :

> Cindy doesn't have any Nebulas or NEO. She is kinda old-school and only owns BTC, BCH, ETH and EOS.
