I quit the job three months later. but I didn't tell anybody. i tavelled everywhere from beijing to Qingdao, to yunnan province. It's all about feel loneliness and not afraid of being lonely. 

I became pennyless and kinda got stuck in Hangzhou. Therefore, I decided to find a job here and it must be a translation-related job. 

But the payment is just so little. all translation jobs in hangzhou are so little. I really really want to b a translator where i can use the knowledge i learned. 

i felt so suck! life is suck! i sit at a chair around the west lake, checking all the jobs available in hangzhou. and that's when i noticed 8btc was hiring an english editor. i sent them my resume and the boss added me on the APP and asked me to translate an article about bitcoin. 
Bitcoin? i heard of it back in 2014. china daily used to cover a lot of stories about bitcoin in 2014, but mostly negative news. so i always thought it was illegal. 

Anyway, i went back to the hotel right away and started to translate the article. about two or three hours later, i sent the translation to them. at the same night, the boss told me to go to their office. i was s o excited to hear the news. i couln't even sleep at night. 

the next morning i went to visit 8btc. it was a small office with about 20 people. the boss asked me if i know anything about bitcoin, or blockchain. so i told him nada. 

then he asked me to say something about translation. this is what i am good at. haha. he also asked some personal stuff like if u have a bnoyfriend. actually i met a fortuneteller
